# React.js Users Posts and Albums

On the main page, we can see the users table where we can find a user by Search field, and sort users by id, name, username, and email.
If we click on the user name, we can find posts and albums that that user owns. Switching between two tabs (Posts and Albums) we can choose one of the posts or albums to see comments (for posts) and photos (for albums).

You can also share the link from wherever and everything will be saved.
